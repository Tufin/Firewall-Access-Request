Firewall-Access-Request
=======================

An Excel spreadsheet for submitting firewall access requests.

This spreadsheet can be used to submit firewall access requests in Tufin SecureChange which is an automated, cross-vendor platform for firewall policy management.

The spreadsheet contains two sheets:
1. Request: enter and submit the network access request
2. Settings: define system settings

How to use:
1. Install Tufin SecureChange (you may also use the free SecureChange Basic which comes with SecureTrack)
2. Open the spreadsheet
3. Enable macros (if Excel asks you)
4. Go to the Settings sheet and fill in the details
5. Go to the Request sheet, fill in the access request and submit it
6. If all goes well a popup will say "Ticket was submitted successfully."
7. If you get an error message check that settings and make sure that the request matches the workflow settings
